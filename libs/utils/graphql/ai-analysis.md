# AI Analysis - utils/graphql

## Library Overview
The utils/graphql library provides utilities and helpers specifically for working with GraphQL in the Dietizme project, particularly for interactions with the Nhost backend.

## Package Details
- **Name**: @dietizme/utils-graphql
- **Type**: CommonJS module
- **Main Entry**: dist/index.js

## Key Dependencies
- @swan-io/boxed: Functional programming utilities
- @apollo/client: GraphQL client
- graphql: GraphQL core library

## Key Functionality
- GraphQL client configuration
- Query execution utilities
- Error handling for GraphQL operations
- Type-safe GraphQL operations

## Key Files
- `src/execute-query.ts` - Utilities for executing GraphQL queries
- `src/replace-language.ts` - Language-related GraphQL utilities
- `test-setup.ts` - Test setup for Vitest

## Testing
- Uses Vitest for testing
- Test command: `vitest run --coverage`
- Contains test utilities in `test-setup.ts`

## Notable Features
- The library includes both Jest-style test files that have been migrated to Vitest
- Uses functional programming patterns with the Boxed library
- Has specialized error handling for GraphQL operations

## Usage Example
This library is used for making GraphQL queries to the backend:
```typescript
import { executeQuery } from '@dietizme/utils-graphql';

const result = await executeQuery({
  query: GET_RECIPES_QUERY,
  variables: { categoryPath: "CUISINE.MEDITERRANEAN" },
  client: apolloClient
});

result.match({
  Ok: data => handleData(data),
  Error: error => handleError(error)
});
```

## Integration Points
- Used by applications and other libraries for GraphQL communication
- Depends on utils/common for shared utilities
- Works with Apollo Client for GraphQL operations
