# AI Analysis - utils/logging

## Library Overview
The utils/logging library provides logging utilities and services for the Dietizme project, enabling consistent logging across all applications and libraries.

## Package Details
- **Name**: @dietizme/utils-logging
- **Type**: ES module
- **Main Entry**: dist/index.js

## Key Dependencies
- pino: Logging library
- @dietizme/base: Internal base utilities (workspace dependency)

## Key Functionality
- Centralized logging configuration
- Standardized log formatters
- Context-aware logging
- Log level management

## File Structure
- `src/`
  - `index.ts` - Main entry point
  - `lib/`
    - `logging.ts` - Core logging implementation

## Testing
- Uses Vitest for testing
- Test command: `vitest run --passWithNoTests --coverage`
- Currently has no test files (passes with no tests)

## Configuration
The library likely provides configurable logging with:
- Different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Optional structured logging
- Environment-specific configuration

## Usage Example
This library would be used like:
```typescript
import { logger } from '@dietizme/utils-logging';

logger.info('Operation successful', { operationId: '123', duration: 500 });
logger.error('Failed to fetch data', { error: err, requestId: req.id });
```

## Integration Points
- Used by all applications and libraries for consistent logging
- May integrate with monitoring or alerting systems
- Can be configured differently per environment (development, staging, production)

## Notes
- This library uses ES modules format rather than CommonJS
- It's designed to have minimal dependencies
- It's focused on a single responsibility: logging
