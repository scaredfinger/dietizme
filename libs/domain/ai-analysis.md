# AI Analysis - domain

## Library Overview
The domain library contains the core domain models and types for the meal planning system. It defines the foundation upon which other libraries and applications are built.

## Package Details
- **Name**: @dietizme/domain
- **Type**: Library package
- **Current Status**: Early development (contains mostly .gitkeep files)

## Key Concepts
- Food category definitions
- Recipe models
- Meal template structures
- Meal plan domain entities

## Planned Structure
- `/categories` - Food category definitions and hierarchies
- `/recipes` - Recipe domain models
- `/templates` - Meal template structures
- `/plans` - Meal plan entities

## Database Mapping
This library is expected to contain the TypeScript representations of the PostgreSQL database schema:

- Categories with hierarchical paths (e.g., "CUISINE.MEDITERRANEAN.SPAIN")
- Recipes with their associated categories
- Meal templates with component requirements
- Meal plans with assigned recipes

## Usage
This library serves as the foundation for the entire application by providing:
- Type definitions
- Domain constants
- Core entity interfaces
- Domain logic building blocks

## Integration Points
- Used by biz-builder for business logic implementation
- Used by applications for type safety
- May be used by API layers for data validation
